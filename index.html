<h1>Wassup!</h1>

<p>
    I am working on a Website for my computer science internal assessment and would like to get your feedback on it. 
    The said Website's main purpose is to aid IB studentsâ€™ learning process by providing a forum, notes repository, and list of online resource links for each of the IB subjects Saint Jude Catholic School provides. 
    In addition to that, I will also be adding personal management subjects to the Website like time management, college applications, self-help, and how to get a girlfriend or boyfriend. 
</p>



<h3>What the Website does</h3>
<p>
    The forum allows students to start a public discussion regarding any concerns they may encounter during their IBDP education. 
    Students of the same cohort and previous cohorts, as Ill as teachers, can all take part in the discussion. 
    This will not only benefit the current students but also students of the following cohorts who are going to read through the created discussions. 
    <br>
    <br>

    The notes repository allows students to contribute their notes by uploading them to the Website. 
    Other students will be able to browse through the contributed notes and download them for use.
    <br>
    <br>

    The list of online resource links is a feature of the Website that will allow students to share online resources they found helpful during the IB journey. 
    <br>
    <br>

    This Website is exclusive to IB students of Saint Jude Catholic School.

<h3>What I am asking you to help</h3>
<p>
    I am collecting feedback by asking you to meet with us in an online conference and share your screen while using the application under our guidance. 
    Thinking out loud by telling us what you are expecting and what you are thinking is highly encouraged. 
</p>


<p>The session will take approximately 20 minutes and I would offer absolutely nothing for your time. Please tell me if you are interested in sending me a message or email.</p> 


<p>Thank you for reading this letter!</p>
